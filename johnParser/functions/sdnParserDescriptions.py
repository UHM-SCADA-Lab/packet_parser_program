# see /functions/sdnParser.py for more detail
#
# This exists really only for humans. The /functions/sdnParser.py file from 
# which this is called, parses all the information a computer needs. But we 
# (hopefully) aren't computers and this function creates English strings that 
# describe what the parsed data represents. 
#
# This file contains all description subclasses the main 'Packet' class 
# creates.
#
# A way to call the description variable, for example:
# my_Packet = Packet(bytes), where bytes is a packet of type bytes
# my_Packet.ethertype                  | returns a bytes object
#                                      | ex: 0806 (type: bytes)
# my_Packet.desc.ethertype             | returns a string that describes
#                                      | ex: 'Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)'
# my_Packet.arp.opcode                 | returns a bytes object
#                                      | ex: 01 (type: bytes)
# my_Packet.arp.desc.opcode            | returns a string that describes
#                                      | ex: 'Request' (type: string)
# generally:                           |
# my_Packet.variable                   | calls the data of variable
# my_Packet.desc.variable              | calls the description of variable
