# Given a packet with type 'bytes', we want to be able to fully parse the 
# packet down to what every byte does. 
#
# This file contains a main class 'Packet' which parsers the very start of the 
# packet (the Ethernet frame) up to the EtherType field. Then the main class 
# creates a subclass for whatever EtherType the packet was, and that subclass 
# continues parsing the packet until a variable is assigned to every byte.
#
# This file also contains all ethertype subclasses the main 'Packet' class 
# creates.
# 
# Also, every class that is defined in this file, has an individual description 
# class created with it, which are defined 
# at /functions/sdnParserDescriptions.py, see for more detail
#
# A way to call the class's variables, for example:
# my_Packet = Packet(bytes), where bytes is a packet of type bytes
# my_Packet.ethertype                  | returns a bytes object
#                                      | ex: 0806 (type: bytes)
# my_Packet.desc.ethertype             | returns a string that describes
#                                      | ex: 'Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)'
# my_Packet.arp.opcode                 | returns a bytes object
#                                      | ex: 01 (type: bytes)
# my_Packet.arp.desc.opcode            | returns a string that describes
#                                      | ex: 'Request' (type: string)
# generally:                           |
# my_Packet.variable                   | calls the data of variable
# my_Packet.desc.variable              | calls the description of variable
