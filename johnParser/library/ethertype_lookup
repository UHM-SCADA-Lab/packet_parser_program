D28B We plan to use this Ethertype for multiple proprietary protocols.  They are still under development. We will disclose the protocols publicly once they are generally available.
88E4 Via NeTworking Switch Management Protocol (VNTSMP) provides one such solution. Switches that support VNTSMP send and receive VNTSMP PDU with one another. A switch without a CPU module (the Client) uses VNTSMP PDU (QUERY) to encapsulate control protocol PDU, such as BPDU, to the switch equipped with a CPU module (the Server) for processing. The Server then sends the Client a response PDU (REPLY) to tell it what action needs to be taken. The Server can also send a QUERY PDU to the Client for a snapshot of all statistics counters. The Client then returns it in one or more REPLY PDUs.

88C8 In our protocol, only one field must be required. It is two byte "sub-type" field. We manage this sub-type and assign it to each application.  Acutual protocol in each application may be vary. If sub-type is allocated, its protocol and data format can be freely designed.
88B8 IEC 61850 is a global standard for the use in utility communication, in particular for the information exchange between IED's in a power transmission or distribution substation.There are three types of application services that use a specific EtherType. GOOSE uses EtherType field 88b8, GSE management services uses EtherType field 88b9. These two protocols are defined in IEC 61850-8-1. SV (Sampled Value Transmission) uses EtherType field 88ba; the protocol is defined in IEC 61850-9-1 and IEC 61850-9-2.
888D The ANSI FC-BB family of standards that have been developed, or are being developed within the INCITS T11 organization specify that all FC-BBW messages carry a fixed 8 byte Logical Link Control (LLC)/Sub Network Access Protocol (SNAP) field. The FC-BB-x LLC/SNAP header specifies an OUI of hex '00000' and requires a two byte PID that specifies Fibre Channel. This is really not something that should be assigned to a single company but instead be associated with the INCITS T11 organization or ANSI.

8812 Hypercom Corporation uses the EtherType fields for their proprietary Integrated Enterprise Network(IEN) LAN-to-LAN protocols.
8950 The Fast Networking and Transport Protocol (FNTP) is a "stripped down" networking and transport layer protocol that is essentially a "port-mapping" protocol with no networking overhead incurred at all.  It is intended for use in situations where channel capacity is limited (necessitation a minimal overhead protocol) and speed in processing of NPDUs is important.  The details of the protocol can be found in the ISO 29281 international standard.
885C This EtherType is used for real-time communication between medical devices.
893E EL is a connection-based, lightweight transport protocol, providing the transport layer for 9P protocol while avoiding the overhead and complexity of Internet Protocol within the same network broadcast domain.

892E A protocol to enable USB type data and USB type commands to be sent between two devices connected by an IEEE802 link, typically an IEEE802.11 link. The protocol allows encoding of all information that would normally be present in a wired USB request, such as request_id and rcode along with payload data. Defined header structures allow correct delivery of the required fields. The informaion provided through the protocol enables USB like behaviour to be implemented between wirelessly connected devices. www.ozmodevices.com
88B4 WAI is a new authentication protocol that will be used to access authentication in IP based networks. This protocol establishes a logic channel between a station and access equipment by using an EtherType Field to accomplish authentication. WAI can offer secure access control by mutual certificate authentication based on AS (authentication server).WAI is more secure than the most existing authentication protocol and can protect network against attacks.Now we want to request a new EtherType Field to distinguish our new protocol from all all existing protocol in actual network.

22EE    In transport network, there are many clients such as PPP, ATM, FC, etc. It is necessary to have an Ethernet type code which is followed by a 16-bit Subtype filed. The subtype field identify the client with specific requirement such as QoS. 
22E8 Ethernet bonding (inverse multiplexing) protocol. Ethernet bonding enables use of multiple low-datarate physical links to provide a high-datarate logical link, without identifying flows (as in LAG) or fragmenting frames (as in PME aggregation).Ethernet bonding performs explicit differential delay compensation and explicit link bandwidth allocation.Ethernet bonding can exploit links with different data-rates, and does not fragment packets. The Ethernet bonding header precedes the payload Ethertype.For VLAN tagged frames it appears after the VLAN tag header.The entire Ethernet bonding header (including Ethertype) is eight bytes in length. Following the Ethertype, there is a 2-octet &quot;sequence number&quot; field, a 1-octet &quot;version&quot; field that must be set to zero, a 1-octet &quot;reserved&quot; field for future use,a 1-octet &quot;flags&quot; field (presently used to identify OAM messages), and a 1-octet &quot;group identifier and intermediate node traversal&quot; field.
88AF Proprietary automotive control unit protocol used by UK OEM Life RacingLtd.
891A The protocol for this Ethertype will allow for software above the driver to periodically send packets. The periodicity allows for significant power savings for devices operating on small batteries. The power saving nature of this protocol requires that it operate at the Ethertype level; it does not fit well into the context of the TCP/IP protocol suite.Our first implementation used an unique OUI for Intel; however, the driver stack from Microsoft Vista requires the use of an EtherType, not an OUI value.
8913 The ethertype is used for an ethernet security protocol used by ethernet link encryption devices manufactured by Rohde & Schwarz.
