#   In order to write this parser at home, I needed bytes objects (in the 
# formatting as seen in lab). The easiest way I found to do this was to save 
# the bytes object as a string (using bytes.hex() function) to a text file. 
# There are better ways to do this, but this was for testing only and is 
# not meant for production use.
#
# The sdnParser and printPKTinfo libraries will be used just as 
# they would be in lab, taking in bytes objects
#
# please see each imported library for more information
#
# This is used for testing only
